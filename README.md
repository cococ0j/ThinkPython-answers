# thinkpython2.0.17-answers
I am new to Python. Thanks to Allen Downey's book -- thinkpython2.0.17. I am failing love with Python.

I wrote some of my answers of practices in the book of thinkpython2.0.17.

Some of them may not be the best answers.

Welcome to fork me and help to improve these answers.

There are also some answers provided by the author, which I added references at the beginning of the code.

(My answers were written in Python 3.5, while the author's were in Python 2.7.)
