# thinkpython2.0.17-answers
I am new to Python. Thanks to Allen Downey's book -- thinkpython2.0.17. I am failing love with Python.
I wrote some of my answers of practices in the book of thinkpython2.0.17.
Some of them may not be the best answers.
Welcome to folk me and help to improve these answers.
Cheers!
